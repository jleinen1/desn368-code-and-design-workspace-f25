1. This project had two main goals: 1) Design a landing page website for a brand, and 2) match that design with code. Throughout the process, some of the requirements were to code a table, a contact form, and CSS animations and transform.
2. I used the hover transform on my feature cards to make them stand out.
3. I wanted to do something subtle so I used a fadeIn animation so that the content would fade gently onto the screen when the page loads.
4. My biggest struggle was the coding the table in HTML, and styling it to make it readable/not overwhelming to look at. I had a hard time centering the table because of syntax errors. I went in and cleaned up my code, and got rid of unnecessary stuff. I also struggled with flexbox during this assignment. Getting the images to layer underneath different elements, such as the form one, was kind of a struggle. 
5. One of my biggest take-aways from this assignment is de-bugging is so important, and the tiniest syntactical errors can mess up a layout. I also liked learning about transform and animations! They are pretty fun and not as intimidating as they seem at first.
