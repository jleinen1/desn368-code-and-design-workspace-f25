1. This project had two main goals: 1) Design a landing page website for a brand, and 2) match that design with code. Throughout the process, some of the requirements were to code a table, a contact form, and CSS animations and transform.
2. I used the hover transform on my feature cards to make them stand out.
3. I wanted to do something subtle so I used a fadeIn animation so that the content would fade gently onto the screen when the page loads.
4. My biggest struggle was the coding the table in HTML, and styling it to make it readable/not overwhelming to look at. I had a hard time centering the table because of syntax errors. I went in and cleaned up my code and that helped a lot!
