    <h3>About Bonnie</h3>
      <p> 
        Bonnie MacLean is often cited as one of the few women to break into the male-dominated world of psychedelic poster art. 
        Her designs combined fantasy, symbolism, and painterly detail.
    </p>
      Her poster work helped define the visual aesthetic of San Francisco’s rock era, 
        swirling typography, organic symmetry, and electric color that mirrored the music and mood of the late 1960s.
    </p>
    <p>
       Today, her work is exhibited in major museums and continues to inspire designers exploring 
        hand-drawn typography and expressive, immersive design.
