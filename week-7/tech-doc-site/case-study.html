      <h2>Design Decisions</h2>
      <p>
       I wanted to do the liminal space guide because I thought the theme would allow for some interesting and fun visuals. I used black, off-white and a bright glowing teal because I felt they fit nicely. I chose a simple sans-serif for the body text, to curate a clean and digital feel. I also used Playfair for the headers because it contrasts well with inter. </p>

      <h2>Technical Challenges</h2>
      <p>The offset/staggered layout was hard to code. I struggle with flexbox already so this added an extra layer of difficulty. I referenced my notes a lot. The flexbox tutorial was also really helpful, so I kind of built off that.

      <h2>Responsive Strategy</h2>
      <p>I adapted my design for mobile in a few ways. First, I made sure there was a strong hierarchy in the original desktop design. I wanted the hierarchy to translate to a smaller screen once I implemented the media query. I also removed some of the decorative elements on the mobile design.</p>

      <h2>Learning Moments</h2>
      <p>
        I definitely learned a lot more about positioning. I liked learning how to set up the nav bar, and using sticky to keep it in place. I also feel like I learned a lot about media queries. I think it’s cool how much you can do with them.</p>

      <h2>Future Improvements</h2>
      <p>
        There are a lot of things I would want to add to this website. First of all, I would love to add more textures and decorative elements to it. I think it would be fun to pay around more with fonts, and the layout. Also, I wish that I knew Javascript because I think more interactive features would add to the dreamy, surreal vibe I want. </p>
