## Reflection

**What was the hardest part of translating your design to code?**
It was all pretty challenging to be honest! The most difficult part was probably writing the HTML and getting the structure just right. If I made a single typo, it threw the whole project off.

**What CSS property/concept do you feel you understand better now?**
I definitely understand the idea of classes and ID's much better now that I have had some practice with them.

**How closely does your code match your design? What would you do differently?**
I think that I did a decent job matching my code to my Figma design. Everything looks accurate in CodePen, but I am struggling a little with getting the live site to deploy properly with all the styles. The biggest struggle for me was getting the spacing to be accurate.
