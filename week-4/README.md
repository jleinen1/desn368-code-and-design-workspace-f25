## Reflection

**What was the hardest part of translating your design to code?**
It was all pretty challenging to be honest! The most difficult part was probably writing the HTML and getting the structure just right.

**What CSS property/concept do you feel you understand better now?**
I definitely understand the idea of classes and ID's much better now that I have had some practice with them.

**How closely does your code match your design? What would you do differently?**
